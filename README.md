iuthesis
========

A fork of the iuthesis document class: all you need to do is write your
dissertation!

The iuthesis document class (apparently) is valid for dissertations at Indiana
University. This version originally came from the Math department
(http://www.math.indiana.edu/resources/iuthesis.phtml), but has been passed from
CS grad student to CS grad student for quite a while. This particular version of
iuthesis.cls was given to me by Andy Keep.

You'll also find iuthesis-alt.cls, which is what Andy is apparently *actually*
using for his dissertation.

The Makefile here will download the required is-abbrv.bst from Utah's math
department.

thanks!
